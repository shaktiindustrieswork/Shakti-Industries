                            A belt conveyor is a ubiquitous material handling system that moves items, bulk materials, or packages from one location to another using a continuous loop of material—the conveyor belt. This belt is stretched over a frame and is supported along its length by a series of rollers called idlers. The belt is driven at one end by a motorized pulley (the drive pulley), which provides the traction to move the belt and its load. The other end houses a return pulley that guides the belt back to the loading point.
